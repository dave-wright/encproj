        <h3>Revised Project 1</h2>
        <h4>The Problem of Tuning and our Compromised Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Music, being composed of sounds with pitch has no naturally obvious tuning. With all the colors of all audible frequencies and no palette to choose from, a composer would be at a loss, completely unable to write music. And even more so would the musician struggle to decode and perform their creation. How should we go about choosing the palette from which we make music? Choosing a tuning system is almost always a fairly arbitrary compromise between objective acoustic properties and practical considerations. The modern solution is merely the solution that is considered the least compromised, and there is a strong argument that in limiting our musical palette to it, we are missing out on a whole different world of sound.
            <br><br>
            What should be included in a tuning system? Well if you pick two pitches at random they have a very high likelihood of just sounding very dissonant together. And while dissonance is useful, and makes music interesting, without a context of consonance it tends just to sound bad.
            <br><br>
            Every sound is a vibration at a frequency, measured in Hz, determining its pitch (cycles/second). Most sounds we find pleasing such as a string vibrating, or a column of air, resonate and produce quieter pitches, or harmonics, at positive integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. For instance, a plucked string sounding at A 440 Hz, will also produce pitches at 880 Hz (2*440), 1320 Hz (3*440), and so on.
            <br><br>
            We can think about the consonance and dissonance of two notes in terms of how well their harmonics are in tune. This is true when one note is one of the early harmonics of the other. For the most consonant interval – the octave, the harmonics of the higher pitch are exactly featured in the pitch of the lower, and of course, the octave is the first harmonic of the other pitch.
            <br><br>
            Consequently, if we want to create a number of consonant pitches one way to do it is to multiply and divide their frequencies by low integer numbers, effectively producing harmonics or octave displacements of each other. Restricting the multipliers to be 5 and below you get a set of tuning systems called 5-limit tuning. With 5-limit tuning, you can easily derive several tunings with pure-sounding consonant intervals. An interval is just or pure when the ratio between its frequencies is expressed as a ratio of small numbers. Unfortunately, these tunings work great only in one key. To justly tune every key requires so many notes, many sounding very near each other, that it would be impractical on a real instrument.
            <br><br>
            Pythagorean tuning, though likely misattributed to him (Duffin 2007)is recognized as one of the earliest systems in use. As the story goes Pythagoras developed his concept of tuning on the monochord – a simple instrument with one string and a resonating box (Wang 2011). For stringed instruments, dividing the length of the string by some number corresponds to a change in frequency equal to the frequency times that number. Pythagorean tuning observes that low number ratios of string length correspond to more consonant harmonies. Halving the string produces the octave, a ratio of 1:2. Two frequencies an octave apart sound so similar as to be identifiable as very nearly the same note, only higher or lower. Shortening the string by 2/3 produced a tone that was very harmonious when played with its original length. This interval very nearly corresponds with the modern interval of a 5th. By repeatedly shortening the string to 2/3 its length and doubling it to bring it down the octave as needed, Pythagoras was able to construct a scale strikingly similar to the one in use today. Each reduction of the string to 2/3 its length produced a new sounding tone up until the 12th iteration where the new tone sounds very near the starting tone. Unfortunately, this pitch isn’t an exact octave multiple of the starting pitch, and when played together with the base pitch, sounds painfully out of tune. This difference between the base pitch and its unfortunate counterpart is called the Pythagorean Comma. This poses a problem, as the final fifth required to close the loop sounds horribly out of tune, and any keys involving it would sound off.
            <br><br>
            In the modern predominant system of tuning; called twelve-tone equal temperament (12 TET), the only distinction from Pythagorean tuning is that instead of building our scale off of those perfectly tuned fifths with a 3:2 ratio, we instead shrink the fifth so that the comma doesn’t exist. Compared to just tuning, both Pythagorean and 12 TET still have their issues. 12 TET has a very out of tune thirds, and the thirds in pythagorean are still fairly far from just.
            <br><br>
            As thirds became more common music though, people began tempering to a different system. (Sukljan 2018) Quarter comma meantone is a particularly notable historic tuning system. In quarter comma meantone, starting with a base note, say C, you build a justly tuned third above it: E. The difference between that justly tuned E and a Pythagorean third is called the syntonic comma. The size of the fifth can then be tempered (adjusted) accordingly so that constructing a scale in the same way as in Pythagorean tuning yields a justly tuned E. This tuning is called quarter comma meantone, as the amount that the fifths were tempered by is equal to ¼ of the syntonic comma. This stems from the fact that to reach the third in Pythagorean tuning by stacking fifths it takes 4 stacked fifths.
            <br><br>
            Quarter comma meantone is an interesting tuning with arguably several advantages over the modern equal-tempered system. In 12 TET, the third is tuned rather high compared to just tuning. As a consequence when presented with a justly tuned third, trained musicians, and untrained listeners will prefer the justly tuned third over the 12 TET they are accustomed to. (Duffin 2007). This small detuning is actually a big deal. Two instruments playing out of tune won’t have harmonics resonating together and will produce an audible beating sound, an effect greatly amplified by larger ensembles.
            <br><br>
            Like all non-equal-tempered tunings, with a given key center that it is tuned about, meantone will sound slightly different in every single key. In some regards, this could be argued as to the detriment of meantone. For example, one common reason a composer may choose one key over another is because it sits easier in the range of an instrumentalist or vocalist. With meantone tunings, if you aren’t able to retune the instruments around the preferred key center, then a less desirable tuning may be used.
            <br><br>
            However, the flip side of this is that a composer now has 12 unique tunings to play with. Modulating to different keys brings a new feel and tone than is possible in equal temperament. A composer can take advantage of the less desirable so-called “wolf” intervals to produce different and new dissonances. What is lost in flexibility is gained in tonal variety.
            <br><br>
            Several other tuning systems offered different compromises. 1/6th comma meantone is a variant that tempers each 5th by 1/6th of the syntonic comma. It doesn’t have the pure thirds of quarter comma, but it is less harsh in certain keys. There were even several “well” temperaments that tempered each fifth by different amounts, resulting in tunings that allowed a similar scale in all 12 keys. One of these well temperaments is likely the tuning used in Bach’s famous Well-Tempered Clavier, a piece many mistakenly assume is a celebration of 12 TET.
            <br><br>
            There is a big argument to be made that composers wrote for these temperaments, and their specific dissonances and colors. (Wang 2011) When we listen to them today in 12 TET we don’t hear the same harmonies that the composer wrote, never mind the differences in instrumentation. Everyone from Bach to Beethoven used a different tuning from the one that dominates today, and musicians were slow to transition to 12 TET. In 12 TET every key is tuned the same and there was concern that each key’s particular character would be lost. (Duffin 2007)
            <br><br>
            It is useful to remember how much of a construct all these tuning systems are. (Halewood 2015)All the 12-toned systems that we have been looking at stem from the inherently flawed Pythagorean tuning. They only have 12 notes because stacking 12 fifths closely approximates your starting note. To a certain extent restricting the scale to 12 tones in an octave is itself rather arbitrary. For non-musicians, microtonal scales are easier to learn and are perceived as less jarring, supporting the idea that restricting to 12 notes in a scale is rather arbitrary. (Leung 2018) However, if these microtonal scales are equally-tempered they often do an even worse job of approximating justly tuned intervals, producing a number of more dissonant worse tuned intervals. (Bailes 5). Or to better approximate the justly tuned intervals they end up having an impractical number of notes to an octave. 
            <br><br>
            For all its flaws 12 TET is an understandable compromise for the modern age. Despite every note being marginally out of tune with the harmonic series it is a very versatile and practical system. Each key maintaining the same relative tuning has allowed composers in the 20th century and jazz musicians to write music that frequently and smoothly modulates between keys. And equivalent keys make transposing an accompaniment to match the preferred vocal range of a singer a possibility without greatly changing the sound of the music or returning your instrument. But for the average musical student 12 TET is about all they will ever know, and understanding that it is a compromise and not the only option is I think worth more musicians’ consideration.

        <h4>Letter to A Math Teacher</h4>
        <p>Dear Mr. Korsavasich,
            Today my daughter brought home math homework about pi. Usually I am quick to guide her through any difficulties she encounters on her homework, but for pi to be taught, I just don’t understand! Why on earth aren't we teaching tau instead?
            <br><br>
            When I was in college, I discovered tau (which is just 2π) and it completely changed how I thought about circles. Tau represents the circumference of the unit circle, making it so much better than pi, where we're having to multiply by 2 every time to get the full circumference.
            <br><br>
            When my daughter asked me about radians, I had to explain that half a circle is π radians. But with tau, it would simply be τ/2 radians which makes so much more sense. A quarter circle would be τ/4, and so on. It makes it all so much easier to learn and remember.
            <br><br>
            Some people argue that pi is more elegant because the formula for a circle's area is just πr². But with tau, it's just (τr²)/2, which highlights the fact that the area of a circle is just half the product of its circumference (τr) and its radius (r). This shows the relationship between area and circumference, rather than hiding it behind a simpler but less meaningful formula.
            <br><br>
            I understand that pi is deeply ingrained in our tradition of math, but maybe it is time to reconsider it’s place. There's actually a Tau Manifesto that details the history of the number, and refutes any complaints? I'm not saying we need to completely change your math class, but I think maybe you could introduce the concept of tau alongside pi?
            <br><br>
            I care deeply about math education, and I believe this change could help students better understand math with circles. I hope you will consider my suggestions, maybe even teach your students about the superior circle constant.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,
            A deeply concerned father

        <h2>Rhetorical Analysis of a Text Based Artifact</h2>
        <h4>1) Text Based Artifact: “Zarlino’s Harpsichord: A Contribution to the (Pre)History of Equal Temperament”</h4>
        <p>
            The research paper “Zarlino’s Harpsichord: A Contribution to the (Pre)History of Equal Temperament” by Nejc Sukljan during his time at the University of Ljubljana considers the problem of tuning through the lens of Gioseffo Zarlino, a theorist and composer who wrote a treatise on his own system of tuning. 
            <br><br>
            This provides somewhat of an alternative perspective in the field, zooming in on a lesser known piece of tuning history. In that way the paper exemplifies just how varied the solutions to problem of temperment was. It’s a good reminder that beyond the 5 or 6 odd tunings that we primarily hear about, there were numerous bespoke tunings. It was not a standardized thing. 
            <br><br>
            Much of the credibility of this paper is bolstered by it’s publisher and author. It’s author Nejc Sukljan holds a position as an assistant professor in the department of musicology at the University of Ljubljana with degrees in Musicology and History. Musicology being the most relevant field of study to the paper, and the University of Ljubljana being a reputable research university both lend authority to the paper. Additionally, the paper makes heavy use of footnotes – a stylistic choice which facilitates citations, and allows the author to suggest additional reading material and alternative explanations for certain topic. Without footnotes, the paper would likely be less readable for an audience without explicit in-depth knowledge of the subject.
            <br><br>
            Sukljan immediately begins by describing the harpsichord or “gravecembalo” built for Zarlino. The purpose of the description is to establish the harpsichord as a tool from which to explain the strange tuning system used by Zarlino. The paper also includes a sketch of the harpsichord from Zarlino’s treatise. The sketch serves to provide a visual representation of Zarlino’s system that the reader can consult as they learn the system.
            <br><br>
            Following this description of the harpsichord, Sukljan gives a brief history of the pythagorean system, and the need to move away from it toward a system like Zarlino’s. The paper is clearly written for a reader that is already versed in the basic problems of tuning systems, as this initial history is brief and immediately segues into the focus of the paper, that being Zarlino’s own system.
            <br><br>
            The paper then continues in a similar form blending an analysis of Zarlino’s treatise with detailed technical explanations of his system. Sukljan relies heavily on tables and diagrams in order to help the reader parse a topic that otherwise could be seen as data heavy and hard to understand. Notation common to modern western music is used throughout in conjunction with heavy annotation to form a comparison between a system likely familiar to the reader, and the system used by Zarlino. 
            <br><br>
            To summarize, Sukljan’s paper uses rhetorical techniques such as heavy use of diagrams, tables, footnotes, with paragraph flow and structure to contribute an information heavy analysis of a notable tuning system to his field of musicology.
            </p>
        <h2>Reflective Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Working through each of these projects I have learned a lot about researching, writing and analyzing artifacts in different styles.
            <br><br>
            Project 1 helped to further familiarize me with the process of conducting academic research. While I have done research paper's before, few have been as in depth, and I believe working on this project in ENC 2135 helped me refine my process. Specifically, I think it was helpful for me to work on the details involved in the citation and annotation process. Additionally, project 1 allowed me an opportunity to learn about a topic I have been curious about, that being the history of temperament.
            <br><br>
            Project 2 took me out of the role of composer and more into the role of analyzer. Writing rhetorical analyses is something that I think I struggle with. It is often hard for me to find any larger meaning in examining the rhetorical choices found in an artifact. And what I do choose to discuss in a rhetorical analysis often feels like it is obvious and almost not worth writing. 
            <br><br>
            Project 3 was an opportunity for me to compose artifacts in entirely different genres. It forced me to become more familiar with different digital design tools for working in alternative mediums. It also provided an alternative viewpoint through which I could think about rhetorical analysis. In project 3 I was working both sides of rhetoric, thinking of devices to convince, but then analyzing those same devices. At the very least I enjoyed the creative freedom that Project 3 allowed. It was a nice change of pace from the more comparatively more formal worlds of research and analysis.
            <br><br>
            Ultimately I think it is hard to quantify how much or what I have learned in this class. There may be some skills such as time management, and dealing with writer's block that I have had to improve in order to be successful in each project, but I believe much of the value was simply a result of being forced to practice writing. For what is the writing if not a muscle to build, or an art to practice.
